# Project-Ark
A project with the lofty goal of helping animal shelters track data!

Ideally, I'd like to provide support for who's had their shots, who's up for adoption, who's cage needs
cleaning,medicine, food, and more! I'd like to include a virtual assistant that leaves a voice message
or sends an email/text whenever something pressing needs to be addressed by an actual volunteer.
